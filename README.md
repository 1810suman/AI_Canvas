# AI_Canvas
This project is a real-time hand gesture-based drawing application using OpenCV and Mediapipe. It enables users to draw on a virtual canvas using finger gestures detected by a webcam. Features include freehand drawing, erasing, and shape recognition (circles, rectangles, and lines). A virtual color palette allows seamless color selection. Keyboard shortcuts enable switching between drawing modes. The application processes hand movements, detects fingertip positions, and dynamically renders drawings. Perfect for interactive art, educational tools, and creative projects. ðŸš€
